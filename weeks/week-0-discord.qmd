------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Synchronous Meetings

This is a *synchronous* **in-person** course, scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays for 2 hours at a time.

We **will** be meeting every Tuesday and Thursday this quarter, and attendance is expected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using the Class Discord

We'll be using Discord to interact with our peers and group members.

Discord is a platform for text chatting, voice chatting, and screen sharing.

In particular, course office hours are held **in-person**. The office hours for this class are:

#### Mondays & Wednesdays (from 9:10 - 11:00am)

## Join the server

Join the [Stat 331 Server (https://discord.gg/dMadzkGb)](https://discord.gg/dMadzkGb) to start experimenting with the interface.

When you join the server, you will be given some suggestions to get started.

![](images/week-0/welcome_discord.png){fig-alt="A picture of the welcome page when you join the Discord server. The page has links to learn more aboud Discord, customize your server, invite your friends, download the desktop app, access Discord from your phone, and how to reach the help desk."}

I recommend you click through these - and in particular, it is probably a good idea to download the desktop version of Discord, and perhaps to install it on your phone if you wish.

## Set up your account

### Verify your email

To use this Discord server, you **must** have a verified email.

Nobody (including your professors) will be able to see this email, and it does not have to be your Cal Poly email. This is simply to keep the server from being overrun by temporary accounts.

### Create your identity

The first thing you should do is decide what name and picture you would like to use.

![](images/week-0/pic.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of changing the name displayed on your account and the picture associated with your account."}

I would like to **strongly** encourage you to use your **real name and picture**, so that everyone can get to know you. However, if you prefer to remain anonymous, you are free to do so.

![](images/week-0/pic_name.gif){fig-alt="A gif of Regina changing the nickname of her Discord account to Gretchen Weiners, to impersonate her friend."}

(Please do not be like Regina and use the name of another student, however!\
This kind of impersonation will result in a permanent ban from the server.)

### Decide about privacy and notifications

The default settings on the channel are probably just fine for you.\
Feel free to make any changes that work for you, though.

You can change your message notifications:

![](images/week-0/notifications.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing how to change the default notifications on the 'Notifications' and 'Text & Images' sidebars."}

You can edit your privacy settings, although most things are already private:

![](images/week-0/privacy.gif){fig-alt="A gif of changing the privacy settings on the 'Privacy & Safety' tab. The user is toggling between the 'Keep me safe', 'My friends are nice', and 'I live on the edge' options for whether DMs sent to you should be scanned for explicit content."}

### Connect other apps

You can connect other apps to Discord, either for productivity or just for fun.

![](images/week-0/connect_spotify.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing how to connect to different apps using the 'Connections' tab. The user specifically connects to Spotify."}

## Using the Channels

The server is made up of many channels. Some are text chatrooms, while some are "Voice Channels" that connect you via audio to everyone else in the channel.

### Text Channels

Use the `#general` channel for anything and everything:

![](images/week-0/saying_hi.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing Regina (the user) posting a comment to the 'general' text channel. After Regina posts 'Hi Everyone!', Dr. Bodwin (her teacher) responds 'Welcome to Stat 431, Regina'."}

If your question is about course logistics, rather than the material itself, consider using the `#class-logistics` channel:

![](images/week-0/logistics.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing Regina navigating to the class-logistics text channel to ask a question--'What time are the work parties with the professors?'. Dr. Bodwin responds to Regina's message saying that the work parties are 'Mondays and Wednesdays from 2-4pm' and reminds Regina that she can 'Feel free to use this Discord channel anytime!'"}

You can use the specific weekly channels to ask questions about the material...

![](images/week-0/github.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing Regina posting a question to the general-questions text channel, inside Week 0. Week 0 is shown as a subheading and general-questions is tab indented below Week 0, displaying that it is a channel associated with the Week 0 group. Regina asks 'So wait, is GitHub a programming language?', and Dr. Bodwin responds 'Good question, but no. GitHub is a website that is good for tracking changes'."}

... or the specific lab assignment.

![](images/week-0/code_in_chat.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing Regina typing code in the lab-0 text channel. Regina uses the ` symbol (immediately below the escape key) to tell Discord that the text she is typing should be formatted as code."}

Notice that you can use tick marks (```` ``` ````), like in R Markdown, to make your code appear in a formatted code box.

### Private messages

It is also easy to send private messages, to your professor or to each other. These private messages can also easily be used to launch a private video chat and / or screen sharing.

![](images/week-0/private_message.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing Regina sending Dr. Bodwin a DM. Regina clicks on Dr. Bodwin's name in the lab-0 Discord channel, which prompts a pop-up to appear. Regina then types a message in the lower text box titled 'Note'. Once Regina hits enter to send her message, a new page opens displaying her conversation with Dr. Bodwin."}

## Creating your own server

Last but not least - for the teams you are a part of, you may want to use Discord to communicate with each other about the weekly assignments. You can do this by creating your own server! You can easily hop between servers during work parties, to ask each other questions or just to take a break and chat about life.

![](images/week-0/new_server.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing the process of creating your own server. On the left sidebar, the square with a plus symbol (immediately below the icon for her Stat 431 server. When Regina clicks on the + icon, a box appears saying 'Oh, another server, hun?', with two options below it, 'Create a Server' (in blue) or 'Join a server' (in green). Regina clicks on the blue, 'Create a Server' button. After she clicks on this button a new pop-up appears asking her to enter the name of her server. Regina changes the name from 'Regina George's Server' to 'Mean Girls Only'. Once Regina has changed the name of her server, she clicks 'Create'. This takes her to her new Discord server. She then clicks on the link to invite people to join her server, which brings up a pop-up box with the HTTPS link she can give to her friends for them to join the server."}

## See you at the Party!

# Course Structure

## What your typical week will look like

### Coursework

Each week, you will be expected to work through a sequence of readings, videos, and preview activities. (Much like this one!)

These are meant to replace the in-class lecture experience; thus, you should plan to devote about 1 - 3 hours a week to this coursework.

### Preview Activities

*Usually due Tuesdays before the beginning of class (at 12pm)*

Before class, you'll complete Preview Activities which will guide you through your first contact with new concepts.

These will involve readings, videos, along with exercises to build your basic skill fluency. For example, you might be asked to read a chapter from the course textbook, watch a few videos discussing some concepts from the chapter, and then asked to complete some preliminary exercises intended to get you started thinking about how to apply the concepts from the chapter in the context of real data.

You'll submit these exercises online, so that class time can be customized based on your understanding.

### Practice Activities

*Usually due Thursdays at 12pm*

During class, you'll be working with your classmates to complete Practice Activities, which take your Preview Activities a step further. You will collaborate with your team to solve a puzzle, requiring that you accomplish a series of tasks, each of which applies the statistical computing concepts from that week. The purpose of in-class time is for you to be doing statistical computing, with me there to guide you if / when you get lost.

The course meetings on Tuesdays will have at least 1-hour dedicated to working on these practice activities, where you will work in your team. This allows for you to have the ability to ask me questions during the early stages of the activity.

### Lab Assignments

*Usually due Sundays at midnight*

After class, you can reinforce the material through Lab Assignments, which are an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the skills that you've learned. If you got something wrong, don't worry! You'll have a chance to try again.

Labs will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Lab Assignments will be submitted to the **same** Canvas portal as the original assignment.

### Challenges

*Usually due Sundays at midnight*

Each Lab Assignment will have a Challenge Problem, which asks you to extend the skills you've learned in class in some way. Frequently, you have the choice of what you would like to learn. The only requirement is that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.

Although you may discuss ideas with your classmates and seek help from the usual sources, all code and text **absolutely must** be your own.

Challenges will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Challenges will be submitted to the **same** Canvas portal as the original assignment.

## `r emo::ji("check")` Check-in 1.1: Syllabus Quiz

**Question 1:** Where can you visit me for office hours?

- In person
- Zoom
- Discord
- Canvas

**Question 2:** In this course, Preview Activities are due by 12pm every
\_\_\_\_. Practice Activities are due by 12pm every \_\_\_\_. Lab
Assignments and Challenges are due by midnight every \_\_\_\_.

**Question 3:** If you have a question about the course content, what is the
best first step?

- Post your question on Discord in the appropriate channel
- Send Dr. Glanz an email
- Go to student hours on Tuesday or Thursday
- Google it

<!-- **Question 4:** You are permitted to submit up to \_\_\_\_ assignments late.  -->

<!-- **Question 5:** If you need to submit an assignment late, you must do which of  -->
<!-- the following? -->

<!-- - email Dr. Theobold to request a deadline extension -->
<!-- - submit a deadline extension request to the Google Form linked in the syllabus -->
<!-- (and on Canvas) -->
<!-- - request an extension before the deadline has passed -->
<!-- - complete the assignment no later than 3-days after the original deadline -->

<!-- **Question 6:** If you receive a "Growing" on a Lab Assignment problem, what  -->
<!-- should you do? -->

<!-- - read the comments and complete revisions on the problems receiving a "Growing" -->
<!-- - complete revisions on the problems receiving a "Growing" -->
<!-- - read the comments and complete revisions on the entire assignment -->
<!-- - nothing -->

<!-- **Question 7:** For revisions on Lab Assignments and Challenges to be eligible  -->
<!-- for a regrade they need to be turned in with: -->

<!-- - your new answers -->
<!-- - your original answers -->
<!-- - reflections on how your learning progressed from your initial attempt -->
<!-- - nothing -->

**Question 4:** You have finished the week's Practice Assignment, and you want
to know if you did it right. You ask your friend, and they say, "Oh, I got Luke
Skywalker as my answer." This is a violation of Academic Honesty policy.

**Question 5:** You have been working on Lab 3 for what feels like forever and
it seems like you are making little to no progress. You type the prompt into
Google and "Wham!" the first result is a Stack Overflow page with a solution.
You copy-and-paste the solution from the Stack Overflow page into your Challenge
submission and do not reference that you used an outside source. You have 
violated the Academic Honesty policy.

**Question 6:** You have been getting frustrated with finding an error in your
code for hours and finally decide to paste your own generated code into ChatGPT
and ask it to help you debug. ChatGPT immediately finds a missing parenthesis.
You have violated the Academic Honesty policy.

**Question 7** You have been studying for another class, the deadline for Lab 2
is in an hour and you haven't even started. Instead of using a "grace day", you
choose to copy the assignment into ChatGPT and ask it to write code to accomplish
the tasks. ChatGPT spits out code with a style/format different from what we
learned in class; you copy it into your Quarto code chunks and it runs so you
render your assignment and turn it in anyway. You have violated the Academic
Honesty policy.

**Question 8:** Name one of the course learning targets that makes you excited.

**Question 9:** Name one of the course learning targets that makes you nervous.

**Question 10:** Why are you taking this class? What do you hope to learn?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What to do when you have questions

Stuck on something, or have a logistical question about the course? Follow these
easy steps to success!

**Make sure your question isn't already answered somewhere.**

- Double-check the syllabus.

- Double-check the instructions for the assignment.
  * Remember that most details will appear in the Coursework pages or in the Lab
  Assignment instructions - **not** in the submission links on Canvas.

- Double-check the Announcements
  * On the "Account" section of Canvas, under "Notifications", make sure your
  preferences are updated for Announcements. 
  * I recommend opting to receive an email any time an announcement is posted.

![](images/week-0/notifications.png){fig-alt="An image of the Nofication Preferences page on Canvas. This page displays notification settings for different 'Course Activities'. The check mark says to 'Notify me right away' and Dr. Bodwin has this setting selected for course Announcements. The clock symbol says to 'Send daily summary' which Dr. Bodwin does not have selected for any course activities. The calendar icon says 'Send weekly summary' which Dr. Bodwin has selected for due dates and grading policies. The x icon says 'Do not send me anything' and Dr. Bodwin has this selected for course content, files, and announcements created by you."}

**Ask your question on Discord**

- If you post your question to a text channel, you will probably get a fast
  response from a classmate. 
- If not, you will get a response from me within 24-hours.

# Tips for succeeding in this class:

## Take the Coursework pages as seriously as you take in-person lecture.

Flipped classrooms puts you in the driver seat of mastering the course material.
It can be tempting to cut corners to save yourself time, but this will likely
result in you having a less complete understanding of the material.

I encourage you to commit to giving the Coursework segments the same level of
attention that you would ordinarily give to in-class lecture. Put the same
effort into the Preview Activities that you would if you were sitting in a
classroom. In return for your efforts, I promise to choose required videos and
readings carefully, so that I do not waste your time.

## Google is your friend.

The R community has an enormous arsenal of online learning resources. I've
linked a few on the "Extra Resources" module in Canvas, but you can always find
more!

![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3oKIPmM4hkQIf4p5T2/source.gif){fig-alt="A gif showing a news anchor pounding their fists on the desk and shouting 'GOOGLE IT! GOOGLE IT! GOOGLE IT!'."}

Learn to:

-   Google for tutorials and examples
-   Use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to ask questions 
-   Use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for proposed solutions to 
people's questions

## Use your classmates for your benefit!

This course makes use of team-based learning. Every week you will work in a 
team with a peer. Over the course of the quarter you will work with many
different people. Each of these people can be a resource for you and you can be
a resource for them! 

I encourage you to establish study buddies and / or study groups early in the
quarter, even if you don't know anyone yet. The class Discord server is a great
way to get started. I also hope you will be proactive about setting up your own
video chat sessions, phone calls, Google Docs, group chats, etc. (How many
different platforms can you talk about Stat 331 on? Facebook? Snapchat?
Instagram? TikTok? Bumble???)

I hope that we will all be purposeful and creative about finding ways to work as
a team.
