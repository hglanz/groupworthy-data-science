## Common Mishaps

::: {.incremental}
::: {.small}
- **Q1**: Who collected these data? When were the data collected?
- **Q4**: Column titles of `2008` and `2018` are not descriptive! 
    + Creating column names that **describe** the values stored in those columns!
    + The `names_prefix = ` argument to `pivot_wider()` can help you make better column names! 
    + DVS-6: I can create tables which make my summaries clear to the reader
- **Q4**: Unless you specify `.groups = "drop"` within `summarize()` your table 
still is grouped! 
    + `group_by()` + `summarize()` only drops the first group. 
    + If you have two variables inside `group_by()`, then the data will still 
    be grouped by the second variable!
- **Q7**: The data description contains important information! 
    + `mc_toddler` -- Aggregated weekly, full-time **median** price charged for
    Center-based Care for toddlers.
    + `mhi_2018` -- **Median** household income expressed in 2018 dollars.

## Recreating the Plot

> DVS-2: I use plot modifications to make my visualizations clearer to the
> reader

::: {.small}
- Facets ordered based on developmental stage **not** alphabetically
- Ordering colors in the legend so they appear in the same order as the lines
in the plot. 
:::

. . .

> DVS-3: I show creativity in my visualizations

::: {.small}
- Exploring different color themes
    + Personally, I like the `"Accent"` palette from the RColorBrewer package, 
    but you might like others! 
    + Getting 10 colors is hard! I would recommend looking into the 
    `colorRampPalette()` function to get more colors.

## Other "Big Picture" Code Feedback

::: {.small}
> I strongly recommend against nested functions, as they are difficult for
people to understand what your code is doing. Having two lines is not less
efficient and is more readable. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

mutate(age_group = fct_relevel(fct_recode(age_group,
                                          "Infant" = "mc_infant",
                                          "Toddler" = "mc_toddler",
                                          "Preschool" = "mc_preschool"),

# Date + Time Variables

## Why are dates and times tricky?

When parsing dates and times, we have to consider complicating factors like...

-   Daylight Savings Time.
    -   One day a year is 23 hours; one day a year is 25 hours.
    -   Some places use it, some don't.
-   Leap years -- most years have 365 days, some have 366.
-   Time zones.

## `lubridate`

::::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   Convert a date-like variable ("May 8, 1995") to a date or date-time object.

-   Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a date-time object.

-   Convert between time zones.
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The image shows the hex logo for the lubridate R package. The logo is a green hexagon with a stylized calendar in the center. The calendar has a small clock icon overlapping its bottom left corner, symbolizing time-related functions. The text 'lubridate' appears prominently below the calendar icon within the hexagon. Lubridate is commonly used in R for working with date and time data."

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/main/thumbs/lubridate.png?raw=true")
```
:::
:::::

::: callout-note
The `lubridate` package **installs** and **loads** with the `tidyverse`. 
:::

## `date-time` Objects

There are multiple **data types** for dates and times.

-   A date:
    -   `date` or `Date`
-   A date and a time (identifies a unique instant in time):
    -   `dtm`
    -   `POSIXlt` -- stores date-times as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 ("Unix Epoch")
    -   `POSIXct` -- stores date-times as a list with elements for second, minute, hour, day, month, year, etc.

## Creating `date-time` Objects

Create a date from individual components:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

make_date(year = 1995, month = 05, day = 08)
```

## Create a `date-time` Object from a String

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy("August 29, 1991")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

dmy("29-August-1991", 
    tz = "America/Denver")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

dmy_hms("29-August-1991 9:32:12", 
        tz = "America/Denver")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as_datetime("91-08-29", 
            format = "%y-%m-%d")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

parse_datetime("8/29/1991", 
               format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```
:::

## Common Mistake with Dates

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as_datetime(2023-02-6)
```

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

my_date <- 2023-02-6
my_date
```
:::
:::

</br>

::: {.centered}
***What's wrong here?***
:::

<br>

. . .

Make sure you use quotes!

-   2,015 seconds $\approx$ 33.5 minutes

## Extracting `date-time` Components

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

bday <- ymd_hms("1989-01-14 12:03:12", 
                tz = "America/Denver")
bday
```

. . .

</br> 

::::: columns
::: column
::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

year(bday)
month(bday)
day(bday)
```
:::
:::

::: column
::: {.small}
::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

wday(bday)

wday(bday, 
     label = TRUE, 
     abbr = FALSE)
```
:::
:::
:::
:::::

## Subtraction with `date-time` Objects

Doing subtraction gives you a `difftime` object. 

`difftime` objects do not always have the same units -- it depends on the scale of the objects you are working with.

## How old am I?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

today() - mdy(01141989)
```

. . .

</br> 

How long did it take me to type this slide?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

begin <- mdy_hms("10/21/2024 20:40:34")
finish <- mdy_hms("10/21/2024 20:43:11")

finish - begin
```

## Durations and Periods

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Durations** will always give the time span in an **exact number of seconds**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as.duration(
  today() - mdy(01141989)
            )
```

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Periods** will give the time span in more approximate, but **human readable times**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as.period(
  today() - mdy(01141989)
  )
```
:::
:::
:::

## Durations and Periods

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
We can also **add** time to `date-time` objects:

-   `days()`, `years()`, etc. will add a **period** of time.
-   `ddays()`, `dyears()`, etc. will add a **duration** of time.
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.fragment}
Because durations use the **exact** number of seconds to represent days and years, you might get unexpected results. 

</br> 

When is is my 99th birthday?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy(01141989) + years(99)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy(01141989) + dyears(99)
```
:::
:::
:::


## Time Zones...

...are complicated! 

</br> 

Specify time zones in the form:

-   {continent}/{city} -- "America/Denver", "Africa/Nairobi"
-   {ocean}/{city} -- "Pacific/Auckland"

. . .

What time zone does R think I'm in?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

Sys.timezone()
```

## Time Zones

You can change the time zone of a date in two ways:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- ymd_hms("2024-10-24 18:00:00", 
             tz = "Europe/Copenhagen")
```

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
`with_tz()`

::: {.small}
Keeps the instant in time the same, but changes the visual representation.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x |> 
  with_tz()

x |> 
  with_tz(tzone = "Asia/Kolkata")
```
:::
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
`force_tz()`

::: {.small}
Changes the instant in time by forcing a time zone change.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x |> 
  force_tz()

x |> 
  force_tz(tzone = "Asia/Kolkata")
```
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Common Mistake with Dates

When you read data in or create a new date-time object, the default time zone (if not specified) is UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)*.  

. . .

So, make sure you specify your desired time zone!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- mdy("11/20/1993")
tz(x)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- mdy("11/20/1993", 
         tz = "America/Los_Angeles")
tz(x)
```

::: {.small}
*UTC is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)

![](images/jewels.png){fig-alt="The image displays five colorful gemstones placed on a dark surface. Each gem has a distinct color and shape. A rectangular green gem (emerald-like) on the left. A round white gem (resembling a diamond) at the top. An oval pink gem in the center. An oval blue gem in the foreground. An oval yellow gem in the background on the right.

- Converting time zones
- Extracting components of a date
- Filtering based on date components
- Making intervals of time
- Filtering values that fall into an interval
- Finding the duration between two dates
- Modulus division

## Getting Started

The partner who got the most sleep starts as the Developer (typing
and listening to instructions from the Coder)!

- The Coder **does not type**. 
  * The collaborative editing feature should allow you to track what is being 
  typed. 
- The Developer **only types what they are told to type**. 

## Submission

> Submit the name of the thief to the Canvas Quiz.

- Each person will input the full name of the thief into the PA 5.2 quiz. 
- Each person will submit the `PA-5-dates.html` file.
