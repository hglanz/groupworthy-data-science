The following\nsimple equation can be used to calculate the approximate condition index of a\nfish:\n\n$$\\text{condition index} = \\frac{weight}{length^3} \\times 100$$\n\n**1. There are specific units required for the calculation of a condition index -- length must be in centimeters and weight must be in grams. The weight data for the Blackfoot River fish were collected in grams; the length data were collected in millimeters. Transform the length data to the correct units.**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**2. Collecting data of this sort can be very messy! Write a function that will replace unlikely `length` and `weight` measurements with `NA`. Your function should accept at least three inputs:**\n\n+ **a vector of measurements,**\n+ **the minimum reasonable value,**\n+ **the maximum reasonable value.**\n\n**If a value falls outside these bounds, you should replace it with an `NA`.**\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are struggling with the structure of your function, I would suggest reading the [Mutating Function](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html#mutate-functions) from R4DS.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**3. After consulting the [Montana Record Table](https://fwp.mt.gov/fish/anglingData/records) for the four species of trout included in these data, I have conjectured that it is unlikely to have measurements for fish below 5 cm and above 80 cm in length or below 10 g and above 4,000 g in weight. Use your function to modify the `length` and `weight` columns of the `fish` dataset based on my cutoffs.**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**4. Write a function to calculate the condition index of a fish, given inputs of weight and length.**\n\n::: callout-warning\nConsider whether you will write a function that works with vectors (accepting\nvectors as inputs) or a function that works with data frames (accepting a \ndataset and variable names as inputs)!\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**5. Make a thoughtful visualization of how fish conditions have varied over the duration of this study.**\n\n::: callout-warning\n### To be thoughtful...\n\n... you need to use at least a third variable!\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
